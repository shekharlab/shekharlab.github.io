We study fundamental questions in neuroscience using a combination of mathematical modeling and data-driven approaches. Our current efforts are organized in two broad directions. The <span style="color:blue">first</span> direction combines large-scale genomic measurements with data-driven approaches to study neural diversity in various settings. In the <span style="color:blue">second</span> direction, we use continuum physics theory and simulation to understand the initiation and propagation of electrical signaling near neuronal interfaces.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
