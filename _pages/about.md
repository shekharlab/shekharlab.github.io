We study fundamental questions in neuroscience using a combination of mathematical modeling and data-driven approaches. Our current efforts are organized in two broad directions. The <span style="color:blue">first</span> direction combines large-scale genomic measurements with data-driven approaches to understand how diverse neuron types, the building blocks of the brain, develop and evolve. In the <span style="color:blue">second</span> direction, we use continuum theory and simulation to understand the physicochemical processes during the initiation and propagation of electrical signaling in neurons.

We are an small, interdisciplinary team comprised of engineers, physicists, and neuroscientists. Our research is curiosity-driven, and we strongly believe that the most important scientific questions require a confluence of ideas and methods from different fields. We have cultivated close collaborations with neurobiologists, vision scientists, molecular biologists, clinicians, and theorists. We actively nurture a friendly, supportive and collaborative group culture where each member can grow intellectually and professionally, achieving their maximum potential as a scientist.

Our primary home is the [Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE)](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/cbe). On the Berkeley campus, we are also affiliated with the [Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute](https://live-helen-wills-neuroscience-institute.pantheon.berkeley.edu), [Center for Computational Biology](https://ccb.berkeley.edu), [Berkeley Vision Science](https://vision.berkeley.edu/about-us/vision-science-program/), [Berkeley Biophysics](https://qb3.berkeley.edu/biophysics/), and [QB3](https://qb3.berkeley.edu). We are also part of the [Biological Systems and Engineering](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/bse/) division at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL).
